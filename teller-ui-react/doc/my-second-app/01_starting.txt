##3 JSX
React component class, or React component type. 
A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), 
and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. 
React takes the description and displays the result. 
In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. 
Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. 

******
The <div /> syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). The example above is equivalent to
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
    React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
    React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);
